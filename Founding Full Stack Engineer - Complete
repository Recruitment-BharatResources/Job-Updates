Founding Full Stack Engineer
.
Responsibilities

• You'll be responsible for collaborating with product, design, engineers, and even directly with customers to produce world-class products for candidates, employees, and talent teams
• As a full-stack engineer, you will own the delivery of products end-to-end, from writing database migrations to building and styling React components
• You will build and ship high-quality products quickly
• You will build empathy for the customer and build features to solve their needs that we may never have expected or explicitly planned
• You will write up engineering proposals translated from designs or direct customer feedback. You'll be able to convert these proposals into well-scoped and prioritized tasks that you deliver on time
• You will help drive the technical roadmap forward by contributing to architectural decisions and building new infrastructure, services, and applications from zero-to-one
• You will push the quality and excellence bar by advocating for and practicing engineering best practices, including code reviews, testing, code quality, security, and monitoring
• You have a passion for your craft that drives you to improve systems and code without being explicitly told
• You are excited at the opportunity to grow with the company. We are very early, and you will need to level up quickly in both execution and leadership to grow with us
Ideal candidate traits
• Autonomous and high agency - You have a track record of building products end-to-end in environments of high ambiguity. You're known as someone who owns problems and outcomes
• Customer obsessed - You will work directly with customers to build empathy, understand their needs, and provide support. We don't believe you can create a world-class product without deep customer empathy
• Leads with empathy - You're willing, able, and excited to help a fellow team member
• 3+ years as full-time engineer, or 1+ years engineering experience working in fast growing startup
• Has built products using React and Typescript and is familiar with building application backends (microservices or web frameworks)
• Has some experience developing Django applications or knowledge of Python and a working knowledge of Tailwind CSS, GraphQL, NextJS, and Node
• Not Required: A CS degree. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and don't believe you need a university degree to be an exceptional engineer
